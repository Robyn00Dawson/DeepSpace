Added an inventory screen that can be repositioned via dragging and dropping.
Inventory screen displays the character icons in the katundian Crew and it displays the item icons for each item held by each character.
Items are displayed in color if they are ready to use. If the item is exhausted, it is displayed in grayscale.
