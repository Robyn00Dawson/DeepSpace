# DeepSpace
Deep Space is a board game I designed. It is a cooperative game for 1 to 7 players.
This project is an online version using HTML - CSS - Javascript.

The game is still under construction. Consider this the "alpha" version. It needs more playtesting and debugging plus a little bit of polish. 
There are 3 features I plan to add in later releases

~Item trading

~Saving / loading

~Online multiplayer
